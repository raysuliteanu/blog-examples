# Rust Terminal UI (TUI) Example
The Rust code in this project shows an example of a TUI using the `ratatui` crate leveraging the `crossterm` "backend"
implementation, for a blog post coming soon.

The TUI is a simple file viewer, supporting keyboard input to scroll up/down and just to the beginning or end of the file
using <Home>/<End> keys. There are many features missing, left as exercise for the reader, or perhaps that I will play
with in the future e.g. mouse scrolling, line numbers, searching, page up/down, large file support, syntax highlighting,
yada.

Here is a screenshot:
