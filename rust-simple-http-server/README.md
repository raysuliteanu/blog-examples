# Simple HTTP Server in Rust
This code started from the [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io) "Build your own HTTP server"
challenge. This challenge evolved in several steps, to support the following
* a simple 'echo' endpoint
* parsing and returning a header value
* downloading a file
* uploading a file

As such at this stage it's kind of a "strange" HTTP server (and with this commit doesn't
even implement the file upload use case. But I wanted to commit the code to my own repo
as I evolve it and use it in any blogs I might write.
